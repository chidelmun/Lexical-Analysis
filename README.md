# Lexical-Analysis
Lex is a program designed to generate scanners, also known as tokenizers, which recognize lexical patterns in text. Lex is an acronym that stands for "lexical analyzer generator." It is intended primarily for Unix-based systems. 

This repository has some simple examples for simple Language parsers. The goal is to eventually develop a Parser for the SQL Language.
